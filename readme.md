#Demo: On-the-fly Filtering of Connected jQuery Draggables & Sortables#

####jQuery Draggables, jQuery Sortables, Twitter Bootstrap 3####

This is a demo of how one can disable and enable sortables on the fly. The demo consists of a simple Bootstrap grid. By dragging items from the navbar on the left onto the stage on the right-hand side, you can create elements of various bootstrap column widths (1U means a div has .col-xs-1). 

As the rows fill up, the magic starts to happen: the Bootstrap rows shut off on the fly such that users will never be able to put more than 12 grid units in a row.
